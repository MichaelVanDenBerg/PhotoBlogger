After installing and activating the Jetpack plugin follow these steps:

1. Add a new post/page or modify an existing one and give this page a 'featured' tag and add a featured image.
2. Repeat step 1 for any additional slides (maximum = 5). Good luck! ;)

Note: The fullscreen slider will only be shown on the front page.
